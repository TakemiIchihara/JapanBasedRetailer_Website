## Background
> Miyakawa Kagaku Shizai is a family-owned business based in Japan that specializes in drawer storage for scientific settings.
> Their products help labs and research facilities store physical data efficiently, contributing to smoother workflows and better organization.
> With a regular customer base and a long-standing reputation for quality, their mission aligns with supporting the scientific community with reliable and practical storage solutions.


## Problem
> The company needed a digital platform to showcase their products, tell their brand story, and reach potential buyers beyond their existing network.


## Process
> With limited digital materials available, I challenged myself to extract and reinterpret the brand’s identity from a small brochure and the experience of visiting the office.
> I noticed a consistent use of blue tones and a practical, professional tone. From there, I designed a clean and minimal interface that reflects the company’s nature of being reliable and precise.
> I modernized the existing logo to align with digital standards and structured the layout of the website, emphasizing its clarity, product details, and ease of navigation.


## Result
> The final website introduces Miyakawa Kagaku Shizai to the digital environment for the first time, giving the company a professional and trustworthy online presence
> while making essential business and product information easy to access.
